# selfcheck.ps1 — Maintenance self-check for the Anchorlaw DSH project.
#
# Mirrors the Anchorlaw self-reference iron rule: the project must be able to
# verify itself. Checks:
#   1. python + anchorlaw-scanner + anchorlaw availability
#   2. skill manifest validity (DSH naming/frontmatter) via tests/test_manifest.py
#   3. scanner self-scan of the project's own python sources (ERR must be 0)
#   4. installed preset + skills presence under ~/.dsh
#   5. plugin tool-schema shape (compiled JSON-Schema parameters) via
#      tests/check_plugin_schema.mjs — a flat spec would reach the LLM without
#      a top-level type and break every session ("Invalid schema ... type: null").
#   6. preset row resolvability via tests/audit_preset_rows.mjs — every `name:` in
#      the composition must resolve against the harness package set; an upstream
#      rename/removal otherwise surfaces only when a session resume fails to mount
#      (2026-09-09 drift: dsh-workflow-worker-thread → dsh-workflow-ptc).
